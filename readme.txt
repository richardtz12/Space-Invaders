Space Invaders Description:
This game "Space Invaders" created by me is a cross of the original space invaders and the shooting game Galaga. There are two types of enemies: enemies who simply hover in place and observe and relay your whereabouts and enemies who charge towards you and attempt to suicide into you. They have no fear. You play as a tank whose goal is to thwart the alien invasion by taking out every last one of the galactic beasts. If you can destroy all of them before you run out of lives, you win. If you run out of lives and there are still aliens remaining, you lose.
